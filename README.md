## üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Objective

We expect you to develop a small application that's able to remind the user about the timers they set using React (web).

---

## üìù Requirements

Feel free to add anything you think it's important while working on it, but we'd like to provide you a list of important points we're expecting to see in your implementation

### Tech requirements

- It should be built using React (web) by forking this repository.
- You **should not** use any UI library like Bootstrap or Tailwindcss -- but you're welcome to use. **styled-compoents, linaria, sass, less, etc.**.
- You're allowed to use any other library you want but we really value those how can show us they know how to do it from scratch without any library.
- You should develop the product within the rectangle `div` (phone-like) we set in the initial project; so you don't need to worry about responsive design.

### Product requirements

- The user should be able to add how many events they want to the app, which should be listed in the list below.
- The user should be able to remove/delete an event.
  - When you click on an item, it should show the delete (red) UI with the delete and cancel options.
- When the time comes for an event to be triggered, the application should display an `alert()` (or some similar UI) with the your event's description and the timer should be deleted.
- The current time should be shown in the analog clock in the top of the app
  - Can it be animated?
  - Is it possible to build it using CSS?
- Don't forget to allow the user to scroll within the phone-like `div`.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus:

- Unit tests.
- Animations.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Submitting your test

- How to install and run it.
- What requirements have you implemented.
- Explain the project structure (folders) you decided to use.
